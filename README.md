# Image-Text-Match-Deep-Learning-Models

This is the Task 1 of the Advanced Machine Learning Module Assesment Assignment. This code is tested on modified flickr8k data set. There are 4 different classifier models for the task. 

## Model 1 (ResNet50 and CNN)
Model 1 utilizes a pretrained ResNet50 model for vision encoding and a custom CNN structure for text encoding. The model achieves a test accuracy of 86.30%.

## Model 2 (ITM Updated Baseline)
This model is a modified version of the baseline ITM code provided in the assignment. It achieves a test accuracy of 78.73%.

## Model 3 (ResNet50 and BERT Language Model)
Model 3 employs a pretrained ResNet50 model for vision encoding and Google's pretrained BERT language model for text encoding. It demonstrates a test accuracy of 80.28%.

## Model 4 (ResNet50V2 and GPT2 Language Model)
For Model 4, a pretrained ResNet50V2 model is utilized for vision encoding, while OpenAI's pretrained GPT2 language model serves as the text encoder. This model achieves a test accuracy of 76.74%.
